In this project, I apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data for this notebook is provided by a Udacity's partner. For the data security reason, I will not share detailed data here but just demonstrate the analysis procedure.
